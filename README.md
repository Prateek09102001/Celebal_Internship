## Assignments

### Week 1: Data Definition Language (DDL)
Focused on creating, modifying, and deleting database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints to define the database structure.

### Week 2: Built-in Functions
Covered the use of various SQL functions for data manipulation and retrieval, including string functions, date functions, and aggregate functions.

### Week 3: Indexes
Explored indexing techniques to optimize database performance by reducing query execution time, including the creation of single-column and composite indexes.

### Week 4: Triggers
Implemented triggers to automate database tasks, enforce business rules, and maintain data integrity by reacting to specific changes in the database.

### Week 5: Star and Snowflake Schemas
Designed and analyzed star and snowflake schemas for data warehousing, understanding their structure and the advantages they offer in different scenarios.

### Week 6: Change Data Capture (CDC)
Learned methods for tracking and capturing changes in data, focusing on techniques to capture insert, update, and delete operations in a database.

## Project

### Departmental Average Salary Analysis with Threshold Comparison
Conducted an in-depth analysis of average salaries across 10 departments. This analysis involved:
- Calculating the average salary for each department.
- Comparing these averages against predefined thresholds to identify discrepancies.
- Extracting insights based on the findings, such as underpaid or overpaid departments.

## Conclusion

This internship provided a solid foundation in SQL and its practical applications in database management and analysis. The assignments and project collectively enhanced my skills in database design, optimization, and data-driven decision-making.
